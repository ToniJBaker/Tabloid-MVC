# Tabloid MVC Prototype
This is a working prototype application.  The prototype will help better understanding and refining of the product. It won't be as feature-rich or as polished as the final product, but it should implement the core features and be as close to the _current vision_ of the product as possible. 

The application is a multi-user web application with rich user experience.  The the current prototype will utilize ASP<span>.NET</span> Core MVC for rapie development.

### Users

Tabloid MVC will have two types of users:

* **Authors** can create Posts, manage their own Posts, and read and comment on other authors' posts.

* **Admins** can do all the things authors can do, but are also in charge of managing all the data in the system.
